# 🚀 Advanced Guide: High-Performance AI/ML Engineering on WSL

This guide is designed for AI/ML experts who need an optimized, high-performance WSL environment for advanced deep learning, distributed training, and large-scale model fine-tuning. 💡

---
## 🔹 Step 1: Optimize WSL for Performance ⚡

### ✅ Enable WSL 2 & Increase Memory Allocation
Edit the WSL configuration file:
```sh
nano ~/.wslconfig
```
Add the following for better resource management:
```ini
[wsl2]
memory=16GB
processors=8
swap=8GB
graphicsMemory=4GB
diskSize=100GB
```
📌 **Why?**
- Allocates more system resources for heavy AI workloads.
- Enhances model training speed and inference performance.

---
## 🔹 Step 2: Install NVIDIA CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorRT 🚀
```sh
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.0-1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.0-1_all.deb
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y cuda libcudnn8 libcudnn8-dev libnvinfer8 libnvinfer-plugin8
```
📌 **Why?**
- CUDA enables GPU acceleration.
- cuDNN optimizes deep learning workloads.
- TensorRT improves inference efficiency.

### ✅ Validate GPU Installation
```sh
nvidia-smi
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

---
## 🔹 Step 3: Install Advanced AI/ML Libraries 📚
```sh
pip install deepspeed accelerate xformers flash-attn apex triton
```
📌 **What’s Included?**
- `deepspeed` → Optimized distributed training.
- `accelerate` → Multi-GPU/TPU/CPU training simplification.
- `xformers` → Efficient transformer attention mechanisms.
- `flash-attn` → Speeds up attention layers.
- `apex` → NVIDIA's mixed-precision training.
- `triton` → Custom GPU kernel optimization.

---
## 🔹 Step 4: Install and Configure Ray for Distributed Computing 🌍
```sh
pip install ray[default] modin[ray]
```
📌 **Why?**
- Ray enables parallel and distributed AI workloads.
- Modin speeds up Pandas operations on multi-core architectures.

### ✅ Start Ray Cluster
```sh
ray start --head
```

---
## 🔹 Step 5: Install Kubernetes & Deploy AI Workloads 🏗️
```sh
sudo apt install -y kubectl
pip install kubernetes
```
📌 **Why?**
- Kubernetes allows managing AI workloads at scale.
- Useful for deploying AI models in production environments.

### ✅ Verify Installation
```sh
kubectl version --client
```

---
## 🔹 Step 6: Set Up an MLflow Server for Experiment Tracking 📊
```sh
pip install mlflow
mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```
📌 **Why?**
- MLflow helps track experiments, hyperparameters, and model performance.
- Can be integrated with cloud storage.

---
## 🔹 Step 7: Optimize Data Handling with Dask & Polars 🏎️
```sh
pip install dask[complete] polars
```
📌 **Why?**
- `dask` → Parallelized data handling for large datasets.
- `polars` → High-performance DataFrame library for AI preprocessing.

---
## 🔹 Step 8: Implement Model Parallelism with FSDP 🔄
```sh
pip install torch==2.0.1 fairscale
```
📌 **Why?**
- FairScale’s **Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP)** enables large-scale model training across multiple GPUs.

### ✅ Example Usage in Python
```python
from fairscale.nn.data_parallel import FullyShardedDataParallel as FSDP
model = FSDP(model)
```

---
## 🔹 Step 9: Set Up a Remote Development Workflow with VS Code 📡
```sh
code .
```
📌 **Why?**
- VS Code allows remote WSL development with full GPU support.

### ✅ Recommended Extensions:
- **Remote - WSL**
- **Python**
- **Pylance**

---
## 🎯 You’re Now at an Expert Level! 🚀

Your WSL setup is now optimized for high-performance AI workloads, distributed training, and large-scale deployment. Time to build cutting-edge AI models! 💻🔥
